# Security Controls

The controls listed below were kept intentionally simple to match the scale and scope of the system.
The goal was to improve visibility and accountability without overengineering the solution.

This document maps implemented controls to identified risks.

## Implemented Controls

### Audit Logging
- All significant actions are logged:
  - Client connections
  - Message sending
  - Command execution
  - Alerts and disconnects
- Logs include timestamps and user identifiers

### Monitoring and Visibility
- Server console outputs operational events
- Commands such as `/log` provide system insight

### Abuse Awareness
- Broadcast alerts are logged and visible to all users
- Message volume can be analyzed post-event

### Data Integrity
- Logs are append-only
- Thread-safe collections used for shared state

These controls support accountability, monitoring, and post-incident analysis.
