# Threat Model

## System Overview
The system consists of:
- A central chat server
- Multiple remote clients
- Network communication via TCP sockets
- Shared resources (logs, connected clients list)

## Assets
- Chat messages
- Usernames
- Server availability
- Log files (audit and operational)

## Threat Actors
- Curious users
- Malicious users attempting spam or disruption
- Unintentional misuse

## Threat Scenarios
- Message spamming to degrade service
- Abuse of alert functionality
- Denial of service via repeated connections
- Repudiation of user actions

## Trust Boundaries
- Client → Server (untrusted input)
- Server → Log files (trusted storage)

All client input is treated as untrusted.
